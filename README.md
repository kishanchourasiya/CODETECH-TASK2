Project Overview: Student Grade Management System in Java
The objective of this project is to develop a simple Java program that helps users track and manage student grades across different subjects or assignments. The program will allow users to input individual grades, compute the average grade, and display the overall performance along with other relevant details like the letter grade or GPA.

Key Features:
Input of Grades: The user will be able to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
Average Calculation: The program will calculate the average of all the grades entered.
Grade Display: It will display the overall grade, including letter grades or GPA, based on the average score.
User-friendly Interface: The program will prompt the user for input and provide clear output, making it easy to use.
Program Structure
1. Class Design
Student Class: This will store the student’s name, grades, and methods for calculating averages and letter grades.
GradeManager Class: This will handle input/output operations and manage a list of students and their grades.
2. Methods and Functionalities
Input Grades: A method for accepting grades for different subjects.
Calculate Average: A method for calculating the average of all entered grades.
Assign Letter Grade or GPA: A method for assigning letter grades based on the average score using a grading scale.
Display Information: A method that outputs the student’s grades, average, letter grade, and GPA.
Project Breakdown
User Input

Accept grades from the user for each subject/assignment.
Allow input for multiple students.
Handle exceptions for invalid input (non-numeric or out-of-range values).
Grade Calculation

Tools & Libraries:
Java SE for program development.
Scanner for user input.
ArrayList to manage grades for different students and subjects.
Sample Program Flow:
The user is prompted to enter the number of subjects/assignments and then the respective grades.
After the grades are inputted, the program calculates the average grade and determines the letter grade or GPA.
The program displays all the grades, the calculated average, the corresponding letter grade, and the GPA.
